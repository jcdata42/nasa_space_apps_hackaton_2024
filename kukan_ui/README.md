In order to launch the user interface, it is mandatory to install NodeJS and yarn.

- If you don't have NodeJS or Yarn installed, please check: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/js-yarn-package-manager-quick-intro

Once "yarn" is installed, follow these steps (in the 'kukan_ui' folder) in your bash terminal:
 - yarn install
 - yarn start

... this should start a development environment and should open your default web browser. It is recommended to set your browser's width to 850px, as the project has been developed considering a limited bandwidth and limited display size in computing systems in space stations.
